# Library-Management-System
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
- This project is the prototype of a Simple Library Management System. Computerized systems are today’s norm. The workload libraries had become very difficult to manage the students order and books booked by them, when library management systems come into the plot.
- Librarian has a provision to add book details like book title, author name, edition and publication details through the web page. In addition to this, librarian or any user has a provision to search for the available books in the library by the book name.
- A flexible, easy to use, very friendly and cost-effective system that off-loads the hard work done by librarians.
